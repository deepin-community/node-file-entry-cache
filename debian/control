Description: Node.js library implementing a simple cache for file metadata
 File-entry-cache is a super simple cache for file metadata,
 useful for process that work on a given series of files
 and that only need to repeat the job on the changed ones
 since the previous run of the process.
 .
 The module grew from a need for a super simple and dumb in-memory cache
 with optional disk persistence
 for a script to beautify files with "esformatter"
 only processing files that had changed since last run.
 Such use case need "fileSize" and "modificationTime" of the files
 tracked in a simple key/value storage.

Description: Node.js library implementing a simple persistent key/value storage
